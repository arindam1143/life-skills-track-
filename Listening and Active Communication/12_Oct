What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening?

ans->
 1.Give Your Full Attention: When someone is speaking, make a conscious effort to stop what you're doing and give them your full attention. Turn away from distractions, put down your phone or other devices, and make eye contact to show that you're engaged in the conversation.

 2.Maintain Open Body Language: Your non-verbal cues can convey your attentiveness. Maintain an open and inviting body language. Sit or stand in a way that shows you are receptive and ready to listen.

 3.Avoid Interrupting: Resist the urge to interrupt or finish the speaker's sentences. Let them express their thoughts and feelings fully before responding. Interrupting can be seen as dismissive and can hinder effective communication.

 4.Use Verbal and Non-Verbal Cues: Provide feedback to the speaker through verbal and non-verbal cues. Nodding, making brief affirming statements like "I see," "I understand," or "Tell me more," can encourage them to continue sharing.

 5.Empathize and Validate: Try to understand the speaker's perspective and feelings. Reflect back what you've heard to ensure you've understood correctly, and validate their emotions. For example, you might say, "It sounds like you're feeling frustrated about this situation."

 6.Ask Clarifying Questions: If something is unclear, don't hesitate to ask for clarification. Use open-ended questions to encourage the speaker to expand on their thoughts. For example, "Can you provide more details about that?" or "What led you to that conclusion?"

According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening? 
ans->  Reflective listening is a communication strategy that involves mirroring body language, emotions, and verifying the message to ensure better understanding. 


Always take notes during meetings, discussions, or technical conversations to capture important details.

Share the notes with all stakeholders, such as clients, managers, or team members. Ask them to verify if the information is accurate.

Ensure that everyone involved in the discussion agrees on the points discussed to avoid misunderstandings and misinterpretations.

What are the obstacles in your listening process?
ans->Obstacles in the listening process can include distractions, preconceived notions, personal biases, lack of focus, and the desire to respond rather than understand.

What can you do to improve your listening?
ans-> To improve my listening, you can practice active listening, minimize distractions, be patient, show empathy, and ask clarifying questions.

When do you switch to Passive communication style in your day to day life?
ans-> I might switch to a passive communication style in your day-to-day life when you want to avoid conflict, maintain harmony, or when you believe that assertiveness may not be necessary in a particular situation. Passive communication is often used when you prefer not to express your own needs or opinions and prioritize the needs and feelings of others.

When do you switch into Aggressive communication styles in your day to day life?
ans-> I might switch to an aggressive communication style in your day-to-day life when you feel the need to dominate a conversation or situation, assert your authority, protect your own interests, or when you want to express your needs and opinions forcefully without much consideration for others' feelings or viewpoints. However, it's important to note that aggressive communication can be counterproductive and may lead to conflicts and strained relationships if used excessively or inappropriately.

When do you switch into Passive Aggressive (sarcasm/gossiping/taunts/silent treatment and others) communication styles in your day to day life?
 ans->Passive-aggressive communication styles, such as sarcasm, gossiping, taunts, and giving the silent treatment, are typically employed in day-to-day life when an individual wants to express their dissatisfaction, annoyance, or frustration indirectly or passively rather than openly confronting an issue or person. Passive-aggressive behaviors are often used when someone wishes to avoid direct conflict or when they feel powerless to address a problem directly. However, it's important to recognize that passive-aggressive communication can be harmful to relationships and should be used sparingly, if at all. It's generally more effective and healthier to address concerns openly and assertively rather than resorting to passive-aggressive behaviors.
